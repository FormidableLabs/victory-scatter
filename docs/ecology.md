Victory Scatter
=============

Victory Scatter creates a scatter of points from data. Scatter is a composable component, so it does not include an axis.  Check out Victory Chart for easy to use scatter plots and more.

## Examples

Victory Scatter is written to be highly configurable, but it also includes a set of sensible defaults and fallbacks. If no props are provided,

```
 <VictoryScatter/>
```

Victory Scatter will render mock data to help you get started
